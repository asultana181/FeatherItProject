Traditional marketing has given way to the rise of digital marketing as a key component in today's businesses across all industries. Given the level of digitization, there is a clear spike in the demand for Digital Marketing roles across organisations. The digital marketing career scope in the Indian internet industry alone is going to be worth $160 billion by 2025, as per a Goldman Sachs report.

Digital Marketing covers a wide range of activities including Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Search Engine Marketing (SEM), Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing, Influencer Marketing, Analytics and more. Businesses now understand the importance of building up their digital channels to increase brand awareness, create a brand identity and a distinct brand presence, talk to their customers, and communicate important offers. 
This has created a huge demand for digital marketers who are skilled in the latest tools and trends.

    <p>As per a recent internal survey by Emeritus, there is a growing trend to update one’s
         digital skill set across multiple industries. Leading the charge is the IT industry with 21% 
         enrolments followed by other tech focused industries such as BFSI at 12%, E-commerce at 13% and 
         Healthcare at 9%. Even in more traditional industries like FMCG, Manufacturing and Retail, the need 
         to master digital as a marketing channel is evident, hence this is a pan-industry trend. Aspiring candidates with the right skillset and training can take up these roles and help businesses establish their online presence and reach out to their target consumers. Digital marketing courses can help candidates learn the ropes of the industry and get started on their career path. For professionals 
        looking to make a career leap, upskilling, or reskilling in digital marketing is a great option.</p>

        Speaking about the rising interest in Digital Marketing programmes, 
        Mohan Kannegal, CEO India & APAC, Emeritus, said, “According to cohort data at Emeritus, 
        
        we have seen that women have increasingly becoming an integral part of the digital economy. 
        Over 45% of cohorts in our ISB Executive Education 12-week Digital Marketing and Analytics 
        Programme are women and this number has been growing cohort on cohort. While over 2,800 learners
         overall have chosen this programme since we launched it in April 2021, there is clear evidence 
         that there is increasing interest amongst women to choose digital marketing as a career, as we usually have about 10-30% of 
        enrolments as women for our other programmes."
